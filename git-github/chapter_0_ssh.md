# What are SSH Keys?

The **SSH (Secure Shell)** is an access credential that is used in the SSH Protocol. In other words, it is a cryptographic network protocol that is used for transferring encrypted data over the network. The port number of SSH is 22. It allow users to connect with server, without having to remember or enter password for each system. It always comes in key pairs:

- **Public key** - Everyone can see it, no need to protect it. (for encryption function).
- **Private key** - Stays in computer, must be protected. (for decryption function).

### Key pairs can be of the following types:

- **User Key** - If the public key and private key remain with the user.
- **Host Key** - If public key and private key are on a remote system.
- **Session key** - Used when a large amount of data is to be transmitted.

### What is the Secure Shell Key?

Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol that enables secure communication with another computer over an unsecured network, replacing older plain-text methods like Telnet. It encrypts all transmitted data, ensuring that remote access, file transfers, and administrative tasks remain protected from attackers.

- SSH was developed in 1995 to provide secure remote connectivity.
- It prevents login credentials and other sensitive data from being intercepted on the network.
- System administrators can remotely manage servers safely using encrypted connections.
- SSH enables secure execution of commands, file transfers, and system updates.

### Features of SSH

Some of key features of SSH are:

- **Encryption:** Encrypted data is exchanged between the server and client, which ensures confidentiality and prevents unauthorized attacks on the system.
- **Authentication:** For authentication, SSH uses public and private key pairs which provide more security than traditional password authentication.
- **Data Integrity:** SSH provides Data Integrity of the message exchanged during the communication.
- **Tunneling:** Through SSH we can create secure tunnels for forwarding network connections over encrypted channels.

### SSH Functions

There are multiple functions performed by SSH Function, here below are some functions:

- SSH provides high security as it encrypts all messages of communication between client and server.
- SSH provides confidentiality.
- SSH allows remote login, hence is a better alternative to TELNET.
- SSH provides a secure File Transfer Protocol, which means we can transfer files over the Internet securely.
- SSH supports tunneling which provides more secure connection communication.

### SSH Protocol

To provide security between a client and a server the SSH protocol uses encryption. All user authentication and file transfers are encrypted to protect the network against attacks.

### Techniques Used in SSH

There are majorly three major techniques used in SSH, which are

1. **Symmetric Cryptography:** In Symmetric key cryptography the same key used for encrypting and decrypting the message, a unique single shared key is kept between the sender and reciever. For ex: DES (Data Encryption Standard) and AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).

2. **Asymmetric Cryptography:** In Asymmetric key cryptography the key used for encrypting is different from the key used for decrypting the message. For ex: RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) and Digital Signature Algorithm.

3. **Hashing:** Hashing is a procedure used in cryptography which convert variable length string to a fixed length string, this fixed length value is called hash value which is generated by hash function.

### Commands in SSH

There are multiple commands supported by SSH protocol, you can tap on the link if you want to know commands in SSH.

_How does generally WorkThe generalasymmetric?_

For performing encryption and decryption it uses asymmetric cipher. There are many encryption methods:

```
rsa, dsa, ed25519 etc.
```

The general procedure is:

- Public keys from the local computers (system) are passed to the server which is to be accessed.
- The server then identifies if the public key is registered.
- If so, the server then creates a new secret key and encrypts it with the public key which was sent to it via local computer.
- This encrypted code is sent to the local computer.
- This data is unlocked by the private key of the system and is sent to the server.
- The server after receiving this data verifies the local computer.
- SSH creates a route and all the encrypted data are transferred through it with no security issues.

SSH is key-based authentication that is not prone to brute-force attack. It is more convenient and secure than login IDs and passwords (which can be stolen in the middle). There is no exposure of valid credentials, if a server has been compromised.

**Generating an SSH key pair**

```
Open your command prompt
type : ssh-keygen
Press enter
It will ask you for a location. Press Enter for default location.
If its already there, press 'y' to overwrite.
You may enter passphrase as you like, press enter.
```
